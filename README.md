## Graphics Interface (Surface)

### Colours
The website was designed to have a classic clean feel theme. I chose to go with a white background. White gives out a light, clean and professional look. 

### Logo
I decided to not go with a logo design and went with letters instead. Having the letters bold signifies a more daring and strong brand. The impression which I hope to get from the users is that it the product is trustworthy and worth it. 

### Fonts
Aller Regular font which is under San Serif Classification is used for the website. The clean and neat writing allows shoppers to read easily and comfortably. 

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap
- Repositry on GitHub

## Libraries
- The fonts was taken from Font Squirrel. 

## Testing

The webpage was tested on 2 different devices, mobile and desktop. They are responsive. Works well with both devices.
